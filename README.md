# Bangazon

## The Command Line Ordering System

In this group project, you will be allowing a user to interact with a basic product ordering database via a command line interface.

## Ordering System Interface

### Main Menu

```bash
*********************************************************
**  Welcome to Bangazon! Command Line Ordering System  **
*********************************************************
1. Create a customer account
2. Choose active customer
3. Create a payment option
4. Add product to sell
5. Add product to shopping cart
6. Complete an order
7. Remove customer product
8. Update product information
9. Show stale products
10. Show customer revenue report
11. Show overall product popularity
12. Leave Bangazon!
>
```

## Requirements

You will create a series of prompts that will allow the user to create various types of data in your ordering system.

1. Start with writing unit tests. As a group, determine the core functionality of the application. Define classes and methods that you think you need to build. Do that before writing the implementation code for core logic. DO NOT WRITE TESTS FOR THE USER INTERFACE (menu and prompts).
1. All classes and methods must be fully documented.
